# Princess + Arvata setups

When we add a second card to the mix besides our starters, we can make endboards that are significantly more layered and have multiple points of interaction.

This is where [_Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames_] makes her debut as an endboard piece, alongside [_Fire King Avatar Arvata_]. Using Arvata's monster negate to destroy Princess triggers [_Sacred Fire King Garunix_] and sets off multiple interruptions for your opponent to deal with.

Later on, Princess can come back from the GY, destroying Arvata and one of your opponent's cards, building board presence while reducing your opponent's.

Of course, [_Garunix Eternity, Hyang of the Fire Kings_] is there for the grand finale. Correctly sequencing your other interruptions allows you to line up 2 Level 8s and summon him for a final board clear.

>Quite often, this endboard is the best balance between power and reliability, especially when facing the following two cards:
>- [_Mulcharmy Fuwalos_], which nets the opponent a draw for every Special Summon we make out of the Deck or Extra Deck.
>- [_Nibiru, the Primal Being_], which can wipe the entire field, ending our combos.
>
>These combo lines offer protection from Nibiru, give very few draws under Fuwalos, or even both - making them worth considering in matchups where the opponent runs a lot of non-engine and you expect the opponent to have one or both of these handtraps.
