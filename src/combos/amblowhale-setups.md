# 2-card Amblowhale setups

Going further, we can take advantage of Link Summoning to add more utility and more points of interaction to our endboard.

[_Amphibious Swarmship Amblowhale_] is the centerpiece of these endboards. Its job is to spectacularly explode, triggering a chain reaction of effects to continuously interrupt the opponent while also maintaining our board presence.

The [Sunlight Wolf recycling pattern] gets to make its debut here, allowing us to recycle a [_Fire King High Avatar Kirin_] - the spark that will cause Amblowhale to explode - or to retrieve any card needed for follow-up next turn.

Finally, we get to use [_I:P Masquerena_] as one of our interruptions, hiding in the GY until needed, and brought on the field once Amblowhale gets destroyed. Other Link-2s like [_Duelittle Chimera_] are also featured here, although they come up less often.

> Here we start to go into wombo-combo territory. These endboards can be very powerful and flashy, but reaching them means exposing ourselves to various forms of interruption and playing into cards like [_Nibiru, the Primal Being_] or [_Mulcharmy Fuwalos_]. 
>
>It's best to perform them only when you're sure your opponent cannot stop you.
>
> All these combos give your opponent 3 or more draws under Fuwalos, so be cautious and only attempt these if you're sure they don't have it, or if you're confident you'll win anyway.
>
> Some combos can play through Nibiru - they will have a note mentioning that.
