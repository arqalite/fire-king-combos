### 2-card - Sanctuary + any FIRE

This one is a touch more awkward, and you'd probably only go for it if you just didn't draw any way to get to Ponix/Ulcanix.

This route uses [_Sacred Fire King Garunix_] to destroy [_Fire King Courtier Ulcanix_] and Special Summon [_Fire King High Avatar Garunix_]. That gives you the second Level 8 you need to make Hyang.

This unfortunately gives your opponent a draw under [_Mulcharmy Fuwalos_].
