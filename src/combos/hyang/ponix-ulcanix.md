### 1-card - Ponix (Ulcanix route)

This route opts to destroy [_Fire King Courtier Ulcanix_] in order to Special Summon [_Fire King High Avatar Garunix_] from Deck, as the second Level 8 needed to make Hyang.

This unfortunately gives 1 draw under Fuwalos, see the Barong route if you want to avoid that.

This video doesn't cover interrupting your opponent with Hyang, read the **Opponent's turn** section below.
