  - [_Sacred Fire King Garunix_]
  - [_Fire King Avatar Arvata_]
  - [_Fire King Sanctuary_]
  - [_Fire King Island_]
- Cards in extra deck:
  - [_Salamangreat Almiraj_]

#### Steps
- Normal Summon [_Legendary Fire King Ponix_].
- Activate Ponix's effect to add [_Fire King Sanctuary_] from Deck to hand.
- Activate [_Fire King Sanctuary_]. Place [_Fire King Island_] in the Field Zone.
- Link Summon [_Salamangreat Almiraj_] using Ponix.
- Activate [_Fire King Island_], destroying [_Fire King High Avatar Kirin_] in order to add [_Sacred Fire King Garunix_] from Deck to hand.
- A chain forms:
    - Activate Kirin's effect to Special Summon Ponix from GY.
    - Activate Sacred's effect to Special Summon itself from hand.
- Activate Sacred's effect to destroy [_Fire King Avatar Arvata_] from Deck.
- Activate Arvata's effect to Special Summon Kirin from GY.
- Link Summon [_Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf_] using Almiraj and Kirin.
- Link Summon [_Relinquished Anima_] using Ponix.
- Activate Sunlight Wolf's effect to add Kirin from GY to hand.
- Link Summon [_Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames_] using Sunlight and Anima.
- Activate Princess' effect to Special Summon Arvata from GY.
- Link Summon [_Amphibious Swarmship Amblowhale_] using Princess and Sacred.

#### Outcome
You have the full endboard with 5+ points of interaction with your opponent. The Kirin in hand acts as a safeguard in case Princess' effect gets negated, ensuring you can destroy Amblowhale and get things going.

#### Interruptions
  - Princess effect to pop Amblowhale and an opponent's card to Special Summon herself,
  - Amblowhale effect to Special Summon a Link-3 or lower, probably Almiraj.
    - Almiraj effect to protect something, if needed.
  - Sacred Garunix Special Summoning itself from GY, destroying a Fire King from deck.
    - If you pop High Kirin here, you can revive Arvata for a monster negate.
    - Or go for Ulcanix to set up 2 Level 8s via [_Fire King High Avatar Garunix_].
  - If you still have Kirin in hand, you can use its effect to Summon itself by destroying one of your Link Monsters.
  - If a Link-3 or lower is destroyed, Amblowhale can banish itself from GY to destroy a card on the field.
  - If you have 2 Level 8s, you can make Hyang to clear the board.

#### Notes
- This combo **plays into Nibiru**, meaning you are at risk of getting your entire board wiped if your opponent has it.
