### Ulcanix + any FIRE (Sunlight Wolf route)

Starting with Ulcanix enables you to use any FIRE monster for this combo, compared to Ponix requiring either Arvata or High Kirin.

This version uses the [Sunlight Wolf recycling pattern] in order to recover any FIRE monster from the GY. Compared to the Ponix combo, you don't always have Kirin the GY, so you might need to pick up something else (like a Ponix or an Ash Blossom).

#### Outcome
You have the full endboard with 5+ points of interaction with your opponent, and you recovered a FIRE monster from your GY, ideally helping you with follow-up on the next turn.

#### Interruptions
  - When a monster effect is activated - negate with Arvata, destroy Amblowhale.
  - Amblowhale effect to Special Summon a Link-3 or lower, probably Almiraj.
    - Almiraj effect to protect something, if needed.
  - Sacred Garunix Special Summoning itself from GY, destroying a Fire King from deck.
    - If you choose Arvata here, you can revive Kirin to set up 2 Level 8s.
    - If you choose High Kirin, you can revive another monster, then destroy a card on the field.
        - You can revive Ulcanix here, and use her to get Rangbali on the field.
  - Princess effect to pop one of your cards and an opponent's card to Special Summon herself.
  - If a Link Monster is destroyed, Amblowhale can banish itself from GY to destroy a card on the field.
  - If you have 2 Level 8s, you can make Hyang to clear the board.

#### Notes
- This combo **plays into Nibiru**, meaning you are at risk of getting your entire board wiped if your opponent has it.
- The I:P Masquerena route might be more preferable to this one unless you open Ash Blossom or Kirin in hand, so you can add them back to your hand. You should be able to determine which one is better for your situation as you get better at playing the deck.
