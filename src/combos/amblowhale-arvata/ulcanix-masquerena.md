### Ulcanix + any FIRE (I:P Masquerena route)

Starting with Ulcanix enables you to use any FIRE monster for this combo, compared to Ponix requiring either Arvata or High Kirin.

This version adds one additional interruption in the form of [_I:P Masquerena_]. 

During the opponent's turn, you can use Amblowhale's effect to revive Masquerena, which can then Link Summon either [_S:P Little Knight_] or [_Knightmare Unicorn_], giving you an additional way to remove your opponent's cards.

  - [_Garunix Eternity, Hyang of the Fire Kings_]

#### Steps
- Normal Summon [_Fire King Courtier Ulcanix_].
- Activate Ulcanix's effect to destroy a FIRE in your hand, and add [_Legendary Fire King Ponix_] from Deck to hand; then make Ulcanix Level 1.
- Activate Ponix's effect to Special Summon itself from hand.
- Activate Ponix's effect to add [_Fire King Sanctuary_] from Deck to hand.
- Activate Sanctuary; place [_Fire King Island_] in the Field Zone.
- Activate Island's effect to destroy Ulcanix and add [_Sacred Fire King Garunix_] from Deck to hand.
- A chain forms:
    - Activate Ulcanix's effect to Special Summon [_Fire King High Avatar Garunix_] from Deck.
    - Activate Sacred's effect to Special Summon itself from hand.
- Activate Sacred's effect to destroy [_Fire King Avatar Arvata_] from Deck.
- Activate Arvata's effect to Special Summon Ulcanix from GY.
- Link Summon [_I:P Masquerena_] using High Garunix and Ulcanix.
- Link Summon [_Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames_] using Masquerena and Ponix.
- Activate Princess' effect to Special Summon Arvata from GY.
- Link Summon [_Amphibious Swarmship Amblowhale_] using Princess and Sacred.

#### Outcome
You have the full endboard with 5+ points of interaction with your opponent, and you recovered a FIRE monster from your GY, ideally helping you with follow-up on the next turn.

#### Interruptions
  - When a monster effect is activated - negate with Arvata, destroy Amblowhale.
  - Amblowhale effect to Special Summon I:P Masquerena.
  - Sacred Garunix Special Summoning itself from GY, destroying a Fire King from deck.
    - If you choose Arvata here, you can revive Kirin to set up 2 Level 8s.
    - If you choose High Kirin, you can revive another monster, then destroy a card on the field.
      - You can revive Ulcanix here, and use her to get Rangbali on the field.
  - I:P Masquerena's effect to Link Summon either [_S:P Little Knight_] or [_Knightmare Unicorn_].
    - Use their effects to remove one of your opponent's cards.
    - S:P can also banish one card on both sides of the field until the End Phase.
  - Princess effect to pop one of your cards and an opponent's card to Special Summon herself.
  - If a Link Monster is destroyed, Amblowhale can banish itself from GY to destroy a card on the field.
  - If you have 2 Level 8s, you can make Hyang to clear the board.

#### Notes
- This combo **plays into Nibiru**, unless the FIRE monster in hand is Arvata - in that case, destroy Kirin off Sacred. Then you are able to revive Arvata on the 5th summon exactly, instead of reviving Ulcanix. You can negate Nibiru now, but if you destroy something on the field for Arvata you will either need to give up I:P and end on Amblowhale + Arvata, or give up Arvata and use it to make I:P.
