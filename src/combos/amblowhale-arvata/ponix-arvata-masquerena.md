### Ponix + Arvata (I:P Masquerena route)
This combo adds one additional interruption in the form of [_I:P Masquerena_].

During the opponent's turn, you can use Amblowhale's effect to revive Masquerena, which can then Link Summon either [_S:P Little Knight_] or [_Knightmare Unicorn_], giving you an additional way to remove your opponent's cards.

#### Outcome
You have the full endboard with 5+ points of interaction with your opponent. I:P Masquerena is waiting in the GY, and can be revived by Amblowhale, then used to Link Summon either [_S:P Little Knight_] or [_Knightmare Unicorn_].

#### Interruptions
  - When a monster effect is activated - negate with Arvata, destroy Amblowhale.
  - Amblowhale effect to Special Summon I:P Masquerena.
  - Sacred Garunix Special Summoning itself from GY, destroying a Fire King from deck.
    - If you choose Arvata here, you can revive Kirin to set up 2 Level 8s.
    - If you choose High Kirin, you can revive another monster, then destroy a card on the field.
  - I:P Masquerena's effect to Link Summon either [_S:P Little Knight_] or [_Knightmare Unicorn_].
    - Use their effects to remove one of your opponent's cards.
    - S:P can also banish one card on both sides of the field until the End Phase.
  - Princess effect to pop one of your cards and an opponent's card to Special Summon herself.
  - If a Link Monster is destroyed, Amblowhale can banish itself from GY to destroy a card on the field.
  - If you have 2 Level 8s, you can make Hyang to clear the board.

#### Notes
- This combo is Nibiru-proof - Arvata is the 5th summon, so if [_Nibiru, the Primal Being_] is activated you can chain Arvata and negate it by destroying Sacred. This does mean losing 1 material and ending on just Amblowhale, but it's better than losing your entire board.
