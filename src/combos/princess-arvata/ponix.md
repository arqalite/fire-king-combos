#### Requirements
- In hand:
    - [_Legendary Fire King Ponix_]
    - Any Fire King, even another Ponix
- In Main Deck:
    - [_Fire King Sanctuary_]
    - [_Fire King Island_]
    - [_Sacred Fire King Garunix_]
    - [_Fire King Avatar Arvata_]
- In Extra Deck:
    - [_Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames_]

#### Steps
- Normal Summon [_Legendary Fire King Ponix_].
- Activate Ponix's effect to search [_Fire King Sanctuary_].
- Activate Sanctuary; place [_Fire King Island_] in the Field Zone.
- Activate Island, destroy the Fire King in hand to search [_Sacred Fire King Garunix_].
- Activate Sacred's effect to Special Summon itself from hand.
- Activate Sacred's effect to destroy [_Fire King Avatar Arvata_] from Deck.
- Activate Arvata's effect to Special Summon the destroyed Fire King.
- Link Summon [_Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames_] using all 3 monsters.
    - Opponent draws 1 card under Fuwalos.
- Activate Princess to Special Summon Arvata from GY.

#### Interruptions
- Arvata can negate a monster effect, then destroy Princess.
- Sacred can revive from GY, then destroy something from the Deck.
    - Kirin -> Special Summon from GY, pop 1 card.
    - Ulcanix -> Set up 2 Level 8s for Hyang.
- Princess can pop Arvata and one of their cards, then revive herself.
- Arvata can revive something from the GY.
- Sanctuary can make Hyang with 2 Level 8s and wipe the board.
- If destroyed, Hyang can replenish the field with 2 Fire Kings from the GY.

#### Outcome
You established board presence and set up a handful of interruptions, while only giving your opponent 1 draw under Fuwalos.

Additionally, your board is protected from Nibiru, as Arvata is summoned on the 5th Summon exactly. If they try to use it, you can negate with Arvata, and ideally destroy something from hand. Princess is also fine, although not ideal.
