### Sanctuary + Kirin + Sacred (1 draw under Fuwalos, stops Nibiru)

This is the first 3-card combo showcased here. We try to steer away from combos that require more than 2 cards, as they usually do the same thing as a 2-card combo, but with more resources. 

That's the case for this combo too, but we do think this particular variation is notable enough to document and demonstrate because it's the first one to give you access to [_Fire King Sky Burn_] and enable it without giving up anything else in exchange for it.

> This works with just Island too, however you'll either have to use Ponix to search Sanctuary, or give up on Hyang.  Either route is fine - determine whether Sky Burn is sufficient for your purposes, or if a board clear is more valuable.

#### Requirements
- In hand:
    - [_Fire King Sanctuary_]
    - [_Fire King High Avatar Kirin_]
    - [_Sacred Fire King Garunix_]
- In Main Deck:
    - [_Legendary Fire King Ponix_]
    - [_Fire King Avatar Arvata_]
    - [_Fire King Sky Burn_]
- In Extra Deck:
    - [_Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames_]

#### Steps
- Activate [_Fire King Sanctuary_]; place [_Fire King Island_] in the Field Zone.
- Activate Island's effect, and chain [_Fire King High Avatar Kirin_] to Island.
- Chain resolves:
    - Kirin destroys [_Sacred Fire King Garunix_] and Special Summons itself.
    - Island destroys the Kirin on field and searches [_Legendary Fire King Ponix_].
- Another Chain forms:
    - CL1: Sacred's effect to Special Summon itself from GY.
    - CL2: Kirin's effect to Special Summon Ponix from hand.
- Yet another Chain forms:
    - CL1: Sacred's effect to destroy [_Fire King Avatar Arvata_] from Deck.
    - CL2: Ponix's effect to add [_Fire King Sky Burn_] from Deck to hand.
- Activate Arvata's effect to Special Summon Kirin from GY.
- Link Summon [_Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames_] using the 3 monsters on the field.
- Activate Princess's effect to Special Summon Arvata from GY.
- Set Sky Burn, and pass turn.

#### Interruptions
- Arvata can negate a monster effect, then destroy Princess.
- Sacred can revive from GY, then destroy something from the Deck.
    - Kirin -> Special Summon from GY, pop 1 card.
    - Ulcanix -> Set up 2 Level 8s for Hyang.
- If you revived Ulcanix, you can search Rangbali for a Spell/Trap negate.
- Princess can pop Arvata and one of their cards, then revive herself.
- Arvata can revive something from the GY.
- Sanctuary can make Hyang with 2 Level 8s and wipe the board.
- If destroyed, Hyang can replenish the field with 2 Fire Kings from the GY.
- At any point, Sky Burn can destroy 1+ cards on each side of the field.

#### Outcome
You established board presence and set up a handful of interruptions, and your opponent only drew 1 card under Fuwalos. You are safe from Nibiru, too, as Arvata hits the field at the 5th summon exactly.

Additionally, you have access to Sky Burn as a powerful interruption during the opponent's turn.
