### Ulcanix + Arvata (2 draws under Fuwalos, stops Nibiru)

Opening both [_Fire King Courtier Ulcanix_] and [_Fire King Avatar Arvata_] insulates you from Nibiru as Arvata hits the field at the 5th summon. 

However this route your opponent 2 draws under Fuwalos. It's not ideal, but it shouldn't be too bad either.

#### Requirements
- In hand:
    - [_Fire King Courtier Ulcanix_]
    - [_Fire King Avatar Arvata_]
- In Main Deck:
    - [_Legendary Fire King Ponix_]
    - [_Fire King Sanctuary_]
    - [_Fire King Island_]
    - [_Sacred Fire King Garunix_]
    - [_Fire King High Avatar Garunix_]
    - [_Fire King High Avatar Kirin_]
- In Extra Deck:
    - [_Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames_]

#### Steps
- Normal Summon [_Fire King Courtier Ulcanix_]. (Nibiru: 1)
- Activate Ulcanix's effect to destroy the [_Fire King Avatar Arvata_] in hand and search [_Legendary Fire King Ponix_].
- Activate Ponix's effect to Special Summon itself from hand. (Nibiru: 2)
- Activate Ponix's effect to search [_Fire King Sanctuary_].
- Activate Sanctuary; place [_Fire King Island_] in the Field Zone.
- Activate Island, destroy Ulcanix to search [_Sacred Fire King Garunix_].
- A chain forms:
    - Activate Ulcanix's effect to Special Summon [_Fire King High Avatar Garunix_] from Deck. (Nibiru: 3; Opponent draws 1 card under Fuwalos).
    - Activate Sacred's effect to Special Summon itself from hand. (Nibiru: 4)
- Activate Sacred's effect to destroy [_Fire King High Avatar Kirin_] from Deck.
- Activate Kirin's effect to Special Summon Arvata from GY. (**Nibiru: 5**)
- Link Summon [_Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames_] using all 3 monsters.
    - Opponent draws 1 card under Fuwalos.

> If your opponent still chooses to use Nibiru at the 5th summon, negate it with Arvata and **destroy Ponix**. That ensures it returns to your hand in the Standby Phase. Then, make Princess with the rest of the monsters, and revive Arvata with her effect.

#### Interruptions
- Arvata can negate a monster effect, then destroy Princess.
- Sacred can revive from GY, then destroy something from the Deck.
    - Kirin -> Special Summon from GY, pop 1 card.
    - Ulcanix -> Set up 2 Level 8s for Hyang.
- If you revived Ulcanix, you can search Rangbali for a Spell/Trap negate.
- Princess can pop Arvata and one of their cards, then revive herself.
- Arvata can revive something from the GY.
- Sanctuary can make Hyang with 2 Level 8s and wipe the board.
- If destroyed, Hyang can replenish the field with 2 Fire Kings from the GY.

#### Outcome
You established board presence and set up a handful of interruptions, and your opponent drew 2 cards.

You are safe from Nibiru, however, as Arvata hits the field at the 5th summon exactly.

It could be worth going into [Amblowhale] or [Amblowhale + Arvata] setups here, as you're protected from Nibiru while having 3 other materials on the field.
