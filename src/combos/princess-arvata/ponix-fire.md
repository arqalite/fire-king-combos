### Ponix + any FIRE (2 draws under Fuwalos)

This one is the weakest of the lines showcased here, as it gives 2 draws under Fuwalos **and** plays into Nibiru.

> If you opened a lot of non-engine, consider the [1-card Hyang setup], as it gives 0 draws under Fuwalos, and doesn't play into Nibiru. The non-engine may be able to fill the role of the interruptions you missed out on.

#### Requirements
- In hand:
    - [_Legendary Fire King Ponix_]
    - Any FIRE monster
- In Main Deck:
    - [_Fire King Sanctuary_]
    - [_Fire King Island_]
    - [_Sacred Fire King Garunix_]
    - [_Fire King Avatar Arvata_]
- In Extra Deck:
    - [_Salamangreat Almiraj_]
    - [_Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames_]

#### Steps
- Normal Summon [_Legendary Fire King Ponix_].
- Activate Ponix's effect to search [_Fire King Sanctuary_].
- Activate Sanctuary; place [_Fire King Island_] in the Field Zone.
- Link Summon [_Salamangreat Almiraj_].
    - Opponent draws 1 card under Fuwalos.
- Activate Island, destroy the Fire King in hand to search [_Sacred Fire King Garunix_].
- Activate Sacred's effect to Special Summon itself from hand.
- Activate Sacred's effect to destroy [_Fire King Avatar Arvata_] from Deck.
- Activate Arvata's effect to Special Summon the destroyed Fire King.
- Link Summon [_Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames_] using all 3 monsters.
    - Opponent draws 1 card under Fuwalos.
- Activate Princess to Special Summon Arvata from GY.

#### Interruptions

- Arvata can negate a monster effect, then destroy Princess.
- Sacred can revive from GY, then destroy something from the Deck.
    - Kirin -> Special Summon from GY, pop 1 card.
    - Ulcanix -> Set up 2 Level 8s for Hyang.
- Princess can pop Arvata and one of their cards, then revive herself.
- Arvata can revive something from the GY.
- Sanctuary can make Hyang with 2 Level 8s and wipe the board.
- If destroyed, Hyang can replenish the field with 2 Fire Kings from the GY.

#### Outcome
You established board presence and set up a handful of interruptions, and your opponent drew 2 cards under Fuwalos.

Unfortunately this line doesn't stop Nibiru, as Arvata is the 6th Summon (we had to summon Almiraj first to have a Fire King in the GY before destroying Arvata from deck). 

Some players might misplay and wait for you to over-extend, letting you get Arvata on the field, but in 99% of cases assume the opponent will Nibiru correctly if they have it.
