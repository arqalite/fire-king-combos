# Kirin + Sacred + any FIRE (2 draws under Fuwalos)

The unique thing about this 3-card combo is that it ends on Arvata + Ulcanix, with Princess in GY. This is essentially the same endboard as the other lines, as Arvata can destroy Ulcanix, and Princess can destroy Arvata and have the same number of interruptions.

It's also a flashy showcase of all the Fire Kings' effects working together. In fact you can switch out Arvata for Rangbali for even more wombo-combo sparkle (and you don't use your Normal Summon!).

To nobody's surprise though, this plays into Nibiru and has no way to stop it.
