### Sanctuary + Ulcanix (2 draws under Fuwalos, stops Nibiru)

This line is a bit more obscure because you'll almost always prefer to do the Ulcanix + any FIRE or Ulcanix + any Fire King lines first, as they get Ponix in the GY where it can be resurrected later.

However if you open Sanctuary, Ulcanix and 3 non-FIRE cards, this is perfectly adequate. It does give 2 draws under Fuwalos, but it stops Nibiru.

> This works with just Island too, however you'll be unable to summon Hyang on the opponent's turn.

#### Requirements
- In hand:
    - [_Fire King Courtier Ulcanix_]
    - [_Fire King Sanctuary_]
- In Main Deck:
    - [_Fire King Island_]
    - [_Sacred Fire King Garunix_]
    - [_Fire King Avatar Arvata_]
- In Extra Deck:
    - [_Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames_]

#### Steps
- Activate [_Fire King Sanctuary_]; place [_Fire King Island_] in the Field Zone.
- Activate Island, destroying Ulcanix for [_Sacred Fire King Garunix_].
- A chain forms:
    - Ulcanix's effect to Special Summon [_Fire King High Avatar Garunix_] from Deck. (Opponent draws 1 card under Fuwalos.)
    - Sacred's effect to Special Summon itself from hand.
- Activate Sacred's effect to destroy [_Fire King Avatar Arvata_] from Deck.
- Activate Arvata's effect to Special Summon Ulcanix from GY.
- Link Summon [_Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames_].
- Activate Princess' effect to Special Summon Arvata from GY.

#### Interruptions
- Arvata can negate a monster effect, then destroy Princess.
- Sacred can revive from GY, then destroy something from the Deck.
    - Kirin -> Special Summon from GY, pop 1 card.
    - Ulcanix -> Set up 2 Level 8s for Hyang.
- If you revived Ulcanix, you can search Rangbali for a Spell/Trap negate.
- Princess can pop Arvata and one of their cards, then revive herself.
- Arvata can revive something from the GY.
- Sanctuary can make Hyang with 2 Level 8s and wipe the board.
- If destroyed, Hyang can replenish the field with 2 Fire Kings from the GY.

#### Outcome
You established board presence and set up a handful of interruptions, and your opponent drew 2 cards.

You are safe from Nibiru, however, as Arvata hits the field at the 5th summon exactly.
