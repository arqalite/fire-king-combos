  - Sacred Garunix Special Summoning itself from GY, destroying a Fire King from deck.
    - If you choose Ulcanix here, you can Special Summon [_Fire King High Avatar Garunix_] from Deck to set up 2 Level 8s.
    - If you choose High Kirin, you can revive another monster, then destroy a card on the field.
  - I:P Masquerena's effect to Link Summon either [_S:P Little Knight_] or [_Knightmare Unicorn_].

  - If a Link Monster is destroyed, Amblowhale can banish itself from GY to destroy a card on the field.
  - If you have 2 Level 8s, you can make Hyang to clear the board.

#### Notes
- This combo stops [_Nibiru, the Primal Being_], at the cost of losing out on either Sunlight Wolf or I:P. 
    - Arvata is summoned on the 5th summon exactly, letting you negate Nibiru as long as it is on the field. 
    - If Nibiru is activated, you can destroy Ponix to ensure it returns to your hand during the next Standby Phase. 
    - A good player might wait until Arvata leaves the field - as such it's worth considering to end on Princess + Arvata instead of going into Amblowhale to thwart their plans.
