### Ulcanix + any FIRE = Amblowhale (Sunlight Wolf + Masquerena)

This combo lets you recycle with Sunlight Wolf **and** get Masquerena in the GY, giving you more flexibility if you don't really need the monster negate from Arvata.

#### Interruptions
  - When you're ready to interrupt, activate Kirin in hand, destroy Amblowhale.
  - Amblowhale effect to Special Summon I:P Masquerena.
  - Sacred Garunix Special Summoning itself from GY, destroying a Fire King from deck.
    - If you choose Arvata here, you can revive Kirin to set up 2 Level 8s.
    - If you choose High Kirin, you can revive another monster, then destroy a card on the field.
        - You can revive Ulcanix here, and use her to get Rangbali on the field.
  - I:P Masquerena's effect to Link Summon either [_S:P Little Knight_] or [_Knightmare Unicorn_].
    - Use their effects to remove one of your opponent's cards.
    - S:P can also banish one card on both sides of the field until the End Phase.

  - If a Link Monster is destroyed, Amblowhale can banish itself from GY to destroy a card on the field.
  - If you have 2 Level 8s, you can make Hyang to clear the board.

#### Notes
- This combo **plays into Nibiru**, unless the FIRE monster in hand is Arvata. Then you are able to revive it on the 5th summon exactly, by reviving it with Kirin instead of reviving Ulcanix. You can negate Nibiru, but if you destroy something on the field for Arvata you will need to give up I:P and go for Sunlight, ending on Amblowhale + Arvata.
