### Ponix + any FIRE &rarr; Amblowhale (with a Link-2 in GY)

This combo lets you use any FIRE alongside Ponix to Link-climb into [_Amphibious Swarmship Amblowhale_] and get a Link-2 of your choosing in GY.

> NOTE: This combo allows you to make any Link-2 and revive it with Amblowhale, as long as you have a way to destroy Amblowhale **that is NOT Princess** (i.e. a [_Fire King High Avatar Kirin_] or [_Circle of the Fire Kings_]). Otherwise, [_Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames_]'s FIRE lock will force you to make a FIRE Link-2, or none at all.

>In the video below we are making [_I:P Masquerena_] - if you need to use Princess to pop Amblowhale, swap Masquerena out for [_Duelittle Chimera_], if you have it in your Extra Deck.

#### Requirements
- In hand:
    - [_Legendary Fire King Ponix_]
    - Any FIRE monster
- In Main Deck:
    - [_Fire King Sanctuary_]
    - [_Fire King Island_]
- In Extra Deck:
    - [_I:P Masquerena_] or [_Duelittle Chimera_]
    - [_Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames_]
    - [_Amphibious Swarmship Amblowhale_]

#### Steps
- Normal Summon [_Legendary Fire King Ponix_].
- Activate Ponix's effect to add [_Fire King Sanctuary_] from Deck to hand.
- Activate Sanctuary; place [_Fire King Island_] in the Field Zone.
- Activate Island, destroying the FIRE in hand to add [_Sacred Fire King Garunix_] from Deck to hand.
- Activate Sacred's effect to Special Summon itself from hand.
- Activate Sacred's effect to destroy [_Fire King Courtier Ulcanix_] from Deck.
- Activate Ulcanix's effect to Special Summon [_Fire King High Avatar Garunix_] from Deck.
- Link Summon [_I:P Masquerena_] (if you have Circle/Kirin/anything similar) or [_Duelittle Chimera_].
- Link Summon [_Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames_].
- Activate Princess to Special Summon any monster from GY.
- Link Summon [_Amphibious Swarmship Amblowhale_] using Princess and the revived monster.

#### Outcome
You have a bunch of layered interruptions set up and ready to go; you have a Link-2 of your choice in the GY, ready to be revived off Amblowhale, and additionally, you have Ulcanix in GY which can be revived later to search a [_Fire King Avatar Rangbali_] or anything you might need for the next turn.

#### Interruptions
  - When you are ready, use an effect to destroy Amblowhale.
  - Amblowhale effect to Special Summon Masquerena or Duelittle.
  - Sacred Garunix Special Summoning itself from GY, destroying a Fire King from deck.
    - If you choose Arvata here, you can revive Kirin to set up 2 Level 8s.
    - If you choose High Kirin, you can revive another monster, then destroy a card on the field.
  - (If available), I:P Masquerena's effect to Link Summon either [_S:P Little Knight_] or [_Knightmare Unicorn_].
    - Use their effects to remove one of your opponent's cards.
    - S:P can also banish one card on both sides of the field until the End Phase.
  - (If unused yet), Princess effect to pop one of your cards and an opponent's card to Special Summon herself.
  - If a Link Monster is destroyed, Amblowhale can banish itself from GY to destroy a card on the field.
    - If the destroyed Link is Duelittle, you get to recover a FIRE from the GY.
  - If you have 2 Level 8s, you can make Hyang to clear the board.

#### Notes
- This combo **plays into Nibiru**, meaning you are at risk of getting your entire board wiped if your opponent has it.
- Once again, pay attention to your hand, and **do not summon Masquerena if you don't have a way to blow up Amblowhale without Princess** - otherwise Princess will lock you out of non-FIRE monsters, meaning Masquerena will be forced to stay in the GY.
