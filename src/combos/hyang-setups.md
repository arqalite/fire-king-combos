# Hyang setups

Let's start simple and low to the ground - just getting the Fire King engine up and running, and then preparing to summon [_Garunix Eternity, Hyang of the Fire Kings_] during the opponent's turn.

> This is a very simplistic endboard, that shines in low-power metas or in longer grind games.
>
> All the following combos play under [_Nibiru, the Primal Being_]'s 5 summon threshold, and they give 0-1 draws under [_Mulcharmy Fuwalos_], making them very safe to perform.
>
> Be sure to weigh your options and determine whether it's worth performing a larger combo, or staying as low to the ground as possible.
>
> The Ponix combos also work with [_Fire King Courtier Ulcanix_] + any FIRE monster, just destroy the FIRE with Ulcanix's effect and search Ponix, then use its effect to Special Summon itself.

There are multiple variants available, including a 1-card combo with just [_Legendary Fire King Ponix_] - the foundation for all the other combos featured in this guide.
